# 🐍 Learning to Play Snake with Reinforcement Learning  
### *A Q-Learning Approach with Reward Shaping and ε-Greedy Exploration*

This project implements an autonomous Snake-playing agent using **tabular Q-learning**, **reward shaping**, and **ε-greedy exploration**.  
The agent learns entirely **from scratch (no expert demonstrations)** through trial and error, and reaches strong performance after training.

## 🚀 Features
- Full Snake environment built with **Pygame**
- RL agent using **Tabular Q-Learning**
- **Reward shaping** for faster convergence
- **ε-greedy exploration** with decay
- **Training curve visualization** (scores + mean scores)
- **Evaluation over 50 games**
- **Boxplot** of evaluation score distribution
- Optional **live demo** of the trained agent
- Clean, extensible codebase
