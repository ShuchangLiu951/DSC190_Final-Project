# 🐍 Learning to Play Snake with Reinforcement Learning  
### *A Q-Learning Approach with Reward Shaping and ε-Greedy Exploration*

This project implements an autonomous Snake-playing agent using **tabular Q-learning**, **reward shaping**, and **ε-greedy exploration**.  
The agent learns entirely **from scratch** through trial and error, and reaches strong performance after training.
